My website is made up of 3 navigable pages, and 1 additional page that is for making a purhcase that requires you to fill
out a form:
	1) Home Page: This page just greets a user when they first navigate to the page. Also, gives a brief insight 
					to the website theme.
					
	2) Shop Page: This page displays all my products (currently only 10 of them). Each cell displays a product image, along
					with additional information pertaining to the product. Each product image is clickable, and takes you
					to a new page that displays the product information in further detail.
					
	3) Purchase Page: This purchase page is the page that is opened when you click on an image. Here you can click on a button
						that will load up a form on the page that will allow you to make a purchase.
	
	4) Our Story Page: This page just gives more detailed background story about the website and its creators. Here we specify 
						our mission and our products that we are selling.
						
Additionally, my webpage has a 'Contact Us' button in the navigation bar that open the mail client so a user can send us an email.
